# LuaCore
A Core for adding Lua to 1.20 plugins (Not a plugin it self just an API)

This API uses [LuaJava](https://github.com/luaj/luaj) to run Lua scripts in your Minecraft Spigot plugin, there is also a GSON config loader built in.
please refer to the wiki once its up for how to use.

[View Repo for how to add](https://repo.selenadevelopment.com/#/releases)

Be sure to add the following to your onEnable() method
`LuaCore.setPlugin(this);`

Wiki will be coming soon, working on [JDocs](docs.selenadevelopment.com/luacore) atm 

You can view the example project used in the wiki examples [here](https://github.com/RedW0lfStoneYT/LuaCoreExample)
